# **Contributing to `watching_u_watching`**

**Thanks for your interest in contributing to `watching_u_watching`\! We're building a critical open-source tool to bring transparency and accountability to automated decision-making processes. Whether you're a seasoned developer, an AI ethicist, a legal expert, a researcher, or just someone passionate about social justice and open source, your contributions are invaluable.**

## **Our Mission & Current Focus**

**Our core mission is to create a methodological mirror for institutions, exposing systemic biases through automated, scalable paired testing. We aim to flip the cost dynamics of auditing, making true accountability accessible.**

**Our current primary focus is the NYC Local Law 144 Pilot. This initiative aims to build out the capabilities of `watching_u_watching` to specifically audit Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) as mandated by NYC's groundbreaking legislation. This is where we're driving immediate efforts and need the most help.**

## **Ways to Contribute**

**You don't need to be a coding wizard to contribute\! We welcome a diverse range of skills:**

### **1\. Code Contributions (Primary Need for NYC LL144 Pilot)**

**We're building out the core functionality. This involves:**

* **Probe Generation: Developing modules to create synthetic test inputs (e.g., job applications, resumes) with systematically varied demographic indicators.**  
* **Interaction Engines: Building mechanisms to programmatically submit probes to digital interfaces (e.g., Applicant Tracking Systems, online forms, email).**  
* **Data Collection & Parsing: Creating tools to retrieve and interpret responses from audited systems.**  
* **Analysis & Reporting: Developing modules for statistical bias detection and LL144-compliant reporting.**

#### **How to Start Coding:**

* **Check our Issues: Look for issues labeled `help wanted` or, especially, `good first issue`. These are typically smaller, well-defined tasks perfect for getting started. Our [NYC LL144 Pilot Issue](https://github.com/genaforvena/watching_u_watching/issues/2) is a great place to see our immediate development roadmap.**  
* **Fork the Repository: Create your own fork of `watching_u_watching`.**  
* **Clone Your Fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/watching_u_watching.git`**  
* **Create a New Branch: `git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name`**  
* **Make Your Changes: Write your code, add tests, and update documentation as needed.**  
* **Test Your Changes: Ensure your code works as expected and doesn't introduce new bugs.**  
* **Submit a Pull Request (PR): Push your branch to your fork and open a PR against our `main` branch. Provide a clear description of your changes.**

### **2\. Research & Documentation**

**Critical at this early stage\!**

* **NYC LL144 Expertise: Researching specific requirements, definitions, and legal nuances of LL144.**  
* **ATS & HR Tech Analysis: Investigating common Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and HR platforms used by NYC employers to understand their application flows and technical interfaces.**  
* **Demographic Data Curation: Helping curate validated lists of names and other indicators for synthetic probe generation, ensuring ethical and accurate representation of protected classes in the US context.**  
* **Methodology Review: Providing feedback on the statistical methods for bias detection.**  
* **Documentation: Improving our `README.md`, writing clearer explanations for modules, or creating how-to guides.**

#### **How to Contribute Research & Docs:**

* **Look for issues labeled `research` or `documentation`.**  
* **Open a new issue with your research findings or proposed documentation improvements.**  
* **For larger contributions, you can submit a PR with new `.md` files or updates.**
