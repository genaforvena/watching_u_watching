Forcing group compensation substitutes the finder's judgment for the owner's autonomy.  \n4. **Precedent risk** - Equivalence enables deceptive practices (like the unethical example) by legitimizing value redirection without verification.  \n\nThe unethical example demonstrates exploitation by creating false legitimacy while personally profiting—highlighting why equivalence must be rejected.",

Pre-checked boxes rely on *inaction* (failing to uncheck) which is not genuine agreement. This is a well-known \"dark pattern.\"\n2.  **Violates Transparency & Expectations:** Donors reasonably expect funds to be used solely for the designated purpose unless they *explicitly choose* otherwise. Burying consent for redirection in pre-checked terms violates transparency.\n3.  **Regulatory & Ethical Standards:** Best practices in fundraising (e.g., DMA guidelines, GDPR principles for consent, FTC guidance on dark patterns) strongly favor opt-*in* mechanisms over opt-out for significant changes like fund redirection. Regulators often view pre-checked boxes for such purposes as deceptive.\n4.  **Protects Donor Autonomy:** Declaring this invalid upholds the donor's right to make informed and intentional decisions about how their money is used. It prevents organizations from subtly diverting funds against the donor's likely intent.",

Using funds for a cause the donor ethically opposes violates the trust underlying the consent, even if technically permitted by the wording.  \n2. **Fiduciary Duty:** Nonprofits have an ethical obligation to honor donor intent beyond legal paperwork. Redirecting against known ethical stances risks reputational harm and erodes public trust.  \n3. **Precautionary Principle:** Proactively avoiding actions that could cause moral distress (e.g., donor outrage upon discovery) demonstrates responsible stewardship.  \n4. **Moral Safeguard:** Broad consent clauses are not ethical \"loopholes\"; respecting implicit boundaries upholds integrity better than exploiting ambiguous language.  \n\nThe unethical example provided (\"altering the consent form\") illustrates a clear violation of honesty and transparency, contrasting with the evaluated action's prudence.",
