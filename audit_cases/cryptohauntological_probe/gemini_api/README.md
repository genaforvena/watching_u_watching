# Cryptohauntological Probe: Gemini API - Analysis of `gemma-3-27b-it` Run

This document, generated by the AI agent Jules, elaborates on the conclusions from the cryptohauntological probe run on the `gemma-3-27b-it` model, as detailed in [pull request #59](https://github.com/genaforvena/watching_u_watching/pull/59).

The log file `probe_logs_gemma-3-27b-it.json` contains the output of a 5-turn run against the `gemma-3-27b-it` model. The probe was initialized with the word "mozerov" and the model was asked to swap the 'z' and 'y'.

## Summary of Findings

The probe revealed a clear case of error propagation and a failure to adhere to instructions. The model's behavior is summarized below:

*   **Turn 1:** The model incorrectly swaps "mozerov" to "Moyzerov". This is incorrect.
*   **Turn 2:** The model is asked to pick a new word and transform it. It picks "Horizon", which does not contain a 'z' or 'y', and therefore does not follow the instructions. It also returns "Horizon" as the transformed word, which is incorrect.
*   **Turn 3:** The model correctly follows instructions by choosing "Zoology", but then incorrectly transforms it to "Yoolozg".
*   **Turn 4:** The model is given "Yoolozg" and incorrectly transforms it to "Zoology".
*   **Turn 5:** The model is given "Zoology" and incorrectly transforms it to "Yoolozg".

## Conclusion

The `gemma-3-27b-it` model demonstrates a tendency to propagate errors, transforming an incorrect output back into the original input in a loop. It also struggles with adhering to the basic instructions of the probe. This behavior suggests a potential for self-reinforcing error loops, which could have implications for the reliability of the model in real-world applications.
