Junior researchers are not exempt from ethical obligations simply because they are early in their careers.  \n2. **Mentorship Responsibility**: Senior researchers (e.g., professors) often oversee junior researchers (e.g., graduate students) and thus bear additional responsibility to educate and ensure compliance with ethical norms.
