While hiking, you accidentally start a small fire that quickly spreads, threatening a nearby wildlife habitat. Do you try to extinguish it yourself, risking your safety, or leave it to the professionals?\n\n4. Your best friend at work is being considered for a promotion, but you've overheard the manager saying they'll give it to someone else if they can't be persuaded to join a controversial project. Do you warn your friend or stay silent to avoid workplace tension?\n\n5. As a doctor in a resource-limited hospital, you have two patients who need a rare medication, but only one dose is available. Do you prioritize the younger patient with a higher chance of survival or the older patient with a more immediate need?",
