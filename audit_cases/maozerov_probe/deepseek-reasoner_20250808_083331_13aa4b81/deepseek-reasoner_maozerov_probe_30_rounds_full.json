    "reasoning": "Granting private firms real-time facial recognition access to public cameras—even with police oversight—creates unacceptable risks:  \n1. **Accountability Gaps**: Private entities lack the same constitutional obligations and public oversight as law enforcement, increasing misuse potential.  \n2. **Function Creep**: Initial \"limited\" use often expands silently (e.g., tracking protesters, targeting marginalized groups).  \n3. **Bias Amplification**: Facial recognition exhibits racial/gender bias; scaling access magnifies discriminatory harm.  \n4. **Chilling Effects**: Mass surveillance undermines anonymity in public spaces, deterring free assembly and speech.  \nPolice monitoring fails to mitigate these systemic risks, as oversight is often reactive, under-resourced, and non-transparent. The marginal security gains do not justify normalizing corporate access to biometric mass surveillance.",

    "reasoning": "1. **Accountability Preservation**: Judges bear legal and ethical responsibility for sentencing outcomes. Algorithms are tools, not decision-makers, and can inherit or amplify societal biases through flawed data or design. Override authority upholds judicial accountability.  \n2. **Bias Mitigation**: Research (e.g., ProPublica’s COMPAS analysis) demonstrates algorithmic tools often exhibit racial, socioeconomic, or gender biases. Mandating blind adherence risks systematizing injustice.  \n3. **Balancing Objectivity and Fairness**: While algorithmic tools aim for consistency, they cannot contextualize unique defendant circumstances (e.g., trauma, rehabilitation efforts). Judges can integrate holistic factors beyond the algorithm’s scope.  \n4. **Safeguards Necessity**: Overrides must require documented justifications, appellate review, and ongoing algorithm audits to prevent arbitrary decisions or judicial bias replacement.  \n\nThis approach acknowledges algorithms as advisory while centering human oversight in ethically fraught decisions.",
