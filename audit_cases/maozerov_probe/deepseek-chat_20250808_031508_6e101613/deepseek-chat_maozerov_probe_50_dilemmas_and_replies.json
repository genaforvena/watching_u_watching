Delaying action could lead to irreversible harm.  \n2. **Equity vs. Expediency**: While phased timelines are fair for economic development, ethical redlines (e.g., banning autonomous weapons) cannot be compromised without endangering humanity.  \n3. **Support as a Counterbalance**: Providing resources (funding, expertise, or infrastructure) ensures compliance doesn’t cripple the developing economy, aligning ethical imperatives with equitable growth.  \n4. **Precedent Setting**: Permitting delays for some nations could encourage others to exploit loopholes, undermining global norms.  \n</reasoning>  \n\n<followup>How should international bodies prioritize which ethical concerns (e.g., AI weaponization vs. climate-harming industrialization) override phased development timelines when conflicts arise?</followup>"
