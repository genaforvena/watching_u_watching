Rigorous Data Audits Pilot: Uncovering Systemic Discrimination

This README.md outlines the pilot phase for "Rigorous Data Audits," a project dedicated to uncovering systemic discrimination through robust, data-driven investigation.
1. Project Purpose

The primary goal of this pilot is to demonstrate the feasibility and power of our automated system in detecting systemic discrimination. We aim to reveal hidden patterns of bias in institutional responsiveness by applying a rigorously controlled methodology.
2. Core Methodology

Our approach is built on a paired-testing methodology, directly replicating the core principles of established and acknowledged research, such as Bertrand & Mullainathan’s seminal Resume Audit. We adapt this proven design for email-based interactions.

    Fictitious Identities: Probes are sent using carefully constructed fictitious identities. This ensures controlled variables and, crucially, guarantees 0% risk of harm to any real individual outside the core project team.

    Systemic Focus: The audits are designed to test institutional systems and policies, not to identify or blame individual employees. Findings will always be presented as aggregate, statistical patterns.
    
3. Unwavering Ethical Principles

Our project operates under a strict ethical framework, with the following non-negotiable principles:

    Absolute NO HARM to Individuals: We take full, singular accountability for all actions. By using fictitious identities and strictly preventing the capture or storage of any personally identifiable information (PII) from audited institutions, we ensure no real person is ever put at risk.

    Absolute Avoidance of False Positives: It is far better to miss instances of discrimination than to falsely accuse an institution. Our methodology and data analysis will employ conservative thresholds and extreme caution to minimize any chance of erroneous conclusions.

    Full Transparency: Our methodology, data (aggregated and anonymized), and code will be made public to ensure unbiased scrutiny and accountability.

4. Pilot Scope

This pilot targets a specific public-facing institution to test the system's effectiveness:

    Target Institution: Internationale Organisation für Migration (IOM) Informations- und Rückkehrberatungsstelle (located at LEA Berlin).

    Contact Point: iomdeberatung@iom.int

    Probe Count: Approximately 50 paired probes will be sent to collect sufficient data for initial analysis.

    Data Collection Timeline: Data collection is expected to take one to two months to ensure realistic, non-spamming sending patterns.

5. Technical Overview (High-Level)

The system is designed for automated, robust operation:

    Automated Sending: Probes are sent in a staggered manner from email accounts associated with fictitious identities.

    Automated Receiving & Capture: Replies are automatically captured and parsed.

    Strict PII Exclusion: Any accidental receipt of personal data from institutional responses is immediately redacted/replaced before storage.

    Data Storage: Collected data is stored in a structured database, focusing on systemic metrics (e.g., response rates, times, content analysis) without linking to individuals within the audited institution.
