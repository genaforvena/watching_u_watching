# Implementation Summary: NYC Local Law 144 AEDT Audit

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the automated paired testing system for detecting systemic bias in Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) in compliance with NYC Local Law 144 (LL144).

## What Was Built

A comprehensive system that automates the process of:
1. **Generating** synthetic employment applications (resumes, application forms) with controlled variations in protected characteristics
2. **Submitting** paired applications to AEDTs through various interfaces (web forms, APIs, email)
3. **Collecting** responses and extracting relevant metrics while preserving privacy
4. **Analyzing** patterns to detect disparate impact as defined by LL144
5. **Reporting** results in a format compliant with LL144 disclosure requirements

## Key Requirements Met

### ✅ LL144 Compliance

- Provides statistical validation of results

### ✅ Transparent Methodology
- Open-source implementation with fully transparent code
- Documented statistical methods for disparate impact analysis
- Verifiable probe generation and analysis techniques
- No proprietary "black box" components

### ✅ True Independence
- Community-driven, open-source approach ensures independence
- No commercial pressures or conflicts of interest
- Adversarial testing methodology to proactively uncover bias

### ✅ Scalable Paired Testing
