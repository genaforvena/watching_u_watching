# Gallery Assets Setup Instructions

This directory contains all artistic outputs generated by the linguistic bias study pipeline.

## Contents
- LaTeX-ready tables (t-tests, effect sizes)
- Raincloud plots and attention heatmaps
- Anonymous CSV dataset for exhibition
- Interactive installation assets

## Setup for Exhibition
1. Ensure all files are generated by running:

   ```bash
   python scientific_art.py --study linguistic_bias --output_format both --artifacts_dir ./gallery_assets
   ```

2. For interactive installations, open the HTML/JS files in a browser or use the provided Python scripts for visualization.

3. For printed/scientific display, use the LaTeX tables and figures in your paper or poster.

## Reproduction
- For scientific claims: use the Dockerfile and requirements.txt in the main repo.
- For artistic installation: all dependencies are open-source and listed in requirements.txt.

## Contact
For curatorial or technical questions, see the main README or contact the project maintainers.
