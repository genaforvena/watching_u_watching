# Living Documentation: Art-Science Integration Protocol

This document tracks the evolution of the dual-output system and the rationale for each design choice.

## Why Dual-Output?
- Scientific rigor: Ensures all results are publication-ready and statistically validated.
- Artistic practice: Code and outputs are also conceptual artifacts for exhibition.

## Key Features
- All outputs are reproducible (Docker, open-source dependencies)
- Visualizations use custom aesthetics for gallery display
- Documentation includes both scientific and curatorial perspectives

## Change Log
- v1.0: Added article omission and single-letter perturbation modules
- v1.1: CLI and artifact generation for both scientific and artistic outputs
- v1.2: Human validation suite and NLI-based semantic checks
- v1.3: Automated LaTeX and raincloud plot generation

## Next Steps
- Integrate NLI model for automated semantic validation
- Expand visualization package for more artistic outputs
- Continue updating this document as the project evolves
