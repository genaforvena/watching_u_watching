# Ethical Framework for Automated Correspondence Testing  

## Core Principles  

### 1. Systemic Analysis Without Individual Attribution  
- Tests decision processes, never individuals  
- Human recipients treated as unmeasured background variables  
- Analysis reports structural patterns only, rejecting personal intent attribution  

### 2. Strict Harm Prevention  
- Uses exclusively synthetic or creator-volunteered identities  
- Prohibits deception about personal attributes  
- Forbids exposure of uninvolved individuals  

### 3. Transparent Methodology  
- All code/schema/outputs released as CC0  
- Test parameters pre-registered and publicly logged  
- Outputs transformed into non-identifiable formats  

### 4. Bias-Aware Implementation  
- Acknowledges inherent methodological limitations  
- Actively invites IRB/external review  
- Framework evolves through documented critique  

### 5. Non-Profit Structural Reporting  
- Prohibits commercial use  
- Forbids punitive applications or individual profiling  
- Outputs restricted to systemic pattern documentation
