# Immutable Principles  
1. **Humans ≠ Systems**:  
   - Institutions are machines; only people deserve protection.  
2. **Data Validity**:  
   - Valid if: Zero PII + open methods.  
   - Never invalidated by: Ransom, coercion claims, or institutional pressure.  
3. **No Material Gain**:  
   - Data is public domain. Profit attempts are morally void.  

## No Takebacks, No Ransom  
This data is:  
- **Free**: CC0 (public domain)  
- **Immutable**: Once published, it cannot be "unpublished"  
- **Weaponizable**: Only against systems, never people  


## Automated Investigative Journalistic Audits
- We're addressing real discrimination that traditional methods can't detect
- Our methodology is transparent and replicable
- The public interest clearly outweighs the modest intrusion of email inquiries
- We're not collecting personal data or causing material harm

## Explained
Automated Investigative Journalistic Audits adhere to the core ethics without compromise. We do not jump through logical hoops; we do not engage in outright lies.

Yes, we send probe emails. But these are not "deception"; they are meticulously designed audit tools. We minimize harm by forcing truth into the light – because darkness is where discrimination thrives. Our public data doesn’t just report harm; it arms the public to dismantle it.

Furthermore, the very automation critics claim diminishes our method, in fact, strengthens it: This systematic approach removes human bias and inconsistency from data collection, ensuring rigorous, objective, and replicable results. This is precisely the kind of accountability journalism that serves the public interest – revealing critical gaps between stated values and actual behavior in organizations that hold themselves out as guardians against discrimination.

And to those who might claim our methods haven't "passed peer review," we assert the opposite: Our approach sets a new, higher standard for transparent accountability. Unlike opaque traditional processes, our methods offer:
* Complete reproducibility: Anyone can run the exact same tests.
* Real-time verification: Findings can be checked immediately by independent parties.
* No gatekeepers: No restrictive IRBs or academic institutions control access to our data or methodology.
* Maximum transparency: Methodology, raw data, and code are all visible and auditable.
This is exactly what investigative journalism should be: holding powerful institutions accountable using rigorous, transparent methods, and making findings available for independent verification. The fact that academic institutions might resist this through their IRB processes actually proves our central point—existing systems often protect institutional power rather than enable genuine public accountability.

To claims that our method should only be a "last resort," we assert it is often the *only* resort for this specific, insidious form of systemic discrimination. Traditional verification methods have severe limitations here:
* No paper trail: Discrimination in responsiveness doesn't leave traditional documents.
* Institutional denial: Organizations will simply deny bias when asked directly.
* Individual cases dismissed: Single instances get explained away as "misunderstandings" or "busy periods."
* No insider access: Unlike corporate malfeasance, there's rarely a whistleblower willing to leak internal discrimination policies.
* Self-reporting bias: Surveys about an organization's own bias are inherently unreliable.
The traditional journalism playbook fails here because Freedom of Information requests won't reveal unconscious bias in email responses; interviews with staff will produce official talking points; whistleblowers rarely emerge over email response patterns; and financial records won't show this type of discrimination. This is precisely their point: Institutions have effectively made themselves audit-proof through the very ethical frameworks they promote. They've created a system where the only "acceptable" ways to investigate them are methods guaranteed to find nothing. The uncomfortable truth: You can't verify systematic discrimination in institutional responsiveness through traditional methods. That's not a flaw in journalism - it's a feature of how institutions have learned to operate. They've made systematic bias invisible to traditional accountability mechanisms.

Their "ethics" aren’t just a shield; they’re a lie by institutional performance. They claim transparency while operating opaquely. They claim anti-discrimination while resisting proof of their compliance. This is not ethics – it’s accountability theater.

An institution that fears public auditing fears the public itself. If your "ethics" forbid the people from verifying your work, your ethics serve power, not justice.

### **Embodying Radical Transparency: Our Open Invitation to Scrutiny**

As a project that champions radical transparency, we are committed to embodying this principle ourselves, not merely in words but in action. Our understanding of transparency extends beyond our own perception; it means being truly transparent in the eyes of others.  
Therefore, we welcome **any and all public or private criticism** regarding perceived inconsistencies, falsehoods, or any perceived lack of transparency from us. We are far from perfect and embrace both criticism and the opportunity to change. It is our explicit duty to guarantee the highest level of transparency requested by those scrutinizing this project.

**What is the point of a philosophy that is not lived by?** For us, the power of an idea lies in its embodiment. Therefore, we welcome **any and all public or private criticism** regarding perceived inconsistencies, falsehoods, or any perceived lack of transparency from us. We are far from perfect and embrace both criticism and the opportunity to change. It is our explicit duty to guarantee the highest level of transparency requested by those scrutinizing this project.

### **My Personal Stance: A Commitment to Sacrifice**

I am so deeply committed to testing this theory that **I offer my persona and identity as a proxy or shield** to anyone who wishes to take part in this investigation but is afraid of the consequences. I will be happy to absorb any and all blame, legal challenges, and personal consequences that may arise. My only goal is to test this theory because, if correct, it forces critical transparency into discrimination. And let's be fair: I am, no matter what, a white, straight male – this world is built around privileges for people like me. It is time to be real and make sacrifices for people who are, for no reason other than who they were simply born to be, oppressed. I feel righteous anger, have nothing to lose, and have had my good times. I owe people.

Our system seeks truth and reports it automatically to minimize harm that systematic discrimination causes. It acts independently (ensuring unbiased scrutiny) and we are accountable and transparent.

Let them jump their hoops as much as they want to — their "ethics" theater is over. If this is unethical, we will be pleased to see them jumping hoops to explain how. Don't be tricked — just count how many words they'll need to make their leaps from what journalism ethics truly say to what they've molded it into.
