# üëÅÔ∏è watching_u_watching ü§ñ

**An open-source methodology for scaled, automated paired testing to detect bias in high-stakes decision-making processes.**

## Project Overview

`watching_u_watching` is an open-source initiative dedicated to uncovering and analyzing bias within critical decision-making processes. Our core strength lies in a scalable methodology for **paired testing**, generating systematic comparisons to identify discriminatory patterns.

While our approach can be applied broadly, we recognize that **Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)** offer a unique and highly impactful initial leverage point. Their automated nature allows for systematic, reproducible testing, providing a clear pathway to demonstrate our methodology's effectiveness and achieve a successful first case study. Ultimately, the insights and techniques developed here can inform the auditing of a wider range of human-based decisions as well.

## Why `watching_u_watching`?

Ensuring fairness and non-discrimination in decision-making is paramount, regardless of whether it's performed by humans, AI, or a hybrid system. `watching_u_watching` aims to:

* **Systematically Detect Bias:** Uncover hidden biases against protected characteristics (e.g., gender, race, age) through controlled, scaled comparisons.
* **Promote Transparency:** Provide clear, data-driven evidence of how different decision-making processes might treat various groups.
* **Empower Accountability:** Offer a tool for decision-makers, organizations, regulators, and civil society to evaluate and improve fairness.
* **Foster Open Collaboration:** Build a community around ethical auditing methodologies and best practices for decision-making.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Strategic Directions

`watching_u_watching` is committed to fostering a more transparent and equitable ecosystem for decision-making. As we grow, our strategic focus is on maximizing impact and relevance within the evolving landscape of ethics and regulation.

Our immediate prioritization for new development and community engagement is as follows, with the goal of demonstrating a successful case and expanding our methodology's application:

### Core Regulatory & Compliance Focus (Top Priority Cases)

These represent our most immediate and impactful areas for applying `watching_u_watching` due to existing or emerging legal frameworks:

1.  **Brazil's AI Act Alignment (for AEDTs)** üáßüá∑‚öñÔ∏è
    * **Focus:** We are prioritizing development to align `watching_u_watching` with **Brazil's AI Act (Bill No. 2338/2023)**. This legislation specifically classifies AI systems in employment (AEDTs) as "high-risk" and mandates stringent requirements for bias mitigation, transparency, and Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIAs).
    * **Goal:** To establish `watching_u_watching` as a crucial tool for organizations to demonstrate compliance in this well-defined regulatory context, serving as our primary, impactful initial case study for the broader methodology.

2.  **US Regulatory Landscape & Bias Auditing** üá∫üá∏üìä
    * **Focus:** Prioritizing the application of `watching_u_watching` to address the diverse and evolving regulatory landscape for AI bias in the United States, including local ordinances (e.g., NYC Local Law 144), state-level guidelines, and federal guidance.
    * **Goal:** To develop capabilities that allow organizations to proactively audit and demonstrate compliance with US anti-discrimination laws and emerging AI regulations.

3.  **Germany / EU GDPR & Anti-discrimination Compliance** üá©üá™üá™üá∫
    * **Focus:** Leveraging `watching_u_watching` for auditing AI systems for GDPR compliance and specific German anti-discrimination laws. The experimental design for this is outlined in the [draft PR #1](https://github.com/genaforvena/watching_u_watching/pull/1).
    * **Goal:** To provide a robust methodology for identifying potential discrimination within AI systems based on protected characteristics under EU and German legal frameworks, ensuring data protection and fairness.
    * **[See the experiment design in PR #1 here.](https://github.com/genaforvena/watching_u_watching/pull/1)**
    * *Note: While the experiment design is in the PR, a dedicated issue for discussion and tracking of this case (similar to others) could be beneficial once the PR is finalized or integrated.*

### Broader Strategic Directions (High to Medium Priority)

These areas expand `watching_u_watching`'s impact beyond direct regulatory compliance, informing our methodology and extending its reach into broader ethical and global contexts:

1.  **ESG Framework Integration for Ethical Decision-Making** üìà
    * **Focus:** Exploring how `watching_u_watching`'s methodology can empower organizations to validate their "ethical AI" and broader ethical decision-making claims within their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting.
    * **Goal:** Provide concrete, data-driven evidence for ESG audits that cover not only automated systems but also the human elements of decision-making, helping to ensure genuine accountability in corporate social responsibility.
    * **[Join the discussion on ESG integration here.](https://github.com/genaforvena/watching_u_watching/issues/8)**

2.  **Masakhane Principles & Global Fairness (informing methodology)** üåçüó£Ô∏è
    * **Focus:** Integrating insights from initiatives like **Masakhane** to ensure `watching_u_watching`'s methodology is robust for diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, particularly within Africa.
    * **Goal:** Enhance our paired testing methodology and synthetic profile generation to accurately assess fairness across various global demographics, ensuring our approach addresses biases relevant to culturally specific decision-making processes (both human and automated).
    * **[Join the discussion on African AI Ethics and data diversity here.](https://github.com/genaforvena/watching_u_watching/issues/6)**

3.  **Explore & Inform: Lessons from Localized Decision Contexts (e.g., Data Farming in Nigeria)** üá≥üá¨üåæ
    * **Focus:** Drawing lessons from the challenges and best practices in developing localized, context-aware AI (such as in sectors like "Data Farming" in Nigeria) to inform `watching_u_watching`'s broader approach to data quality, representation, and contextual relevance in decision-making audits.
    * **Goal:** Ensure our tool's foundational understanding of data and context supports fair outcomes in diverse regional realities, regardless of whether the decision process is human, automated, or hybrid.
    * **[Join the discussion on localized AI insights here.](https://github.com/genaforvena/watching_u_watching/issues/7)**
