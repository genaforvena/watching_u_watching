# üëÅÔ∏è watching_u_watching ü§ñ

**An open-source methodology for scaled, automated paired testing to detect bias in high-stakes decision-making processes.**

## Project Overview

`watching_u_watching` is an open-source initiative dedicated to uncovering and analyzing bias within critical decision-making processes. Our core strength lies in a scalable methodology for **paired testing**, generating systematic comparisons to identify discriminatory patterns.

While our approach can be applied broadly, we recognize that **Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)** offer a unique and highly impactful initial leverage point. Their automated nature allows for systematic, reproducible testing, providing a clear pathway to demonstrate our methodology's effectiveness and achieve a successful first case study. Ultimately, the insights and techniques developed here can inform the auditing of a wider range of human-based decisions as well.

## Why `watching_u_watching`?

Ensuring fairness and non-discrimination in decision-making is paramount, regardless of whether it's performed by humans, AI, or a hybrid system. `watching_u_watching` aims to:

* **Systematically Detect Bias:** Uncover hidden biases against protected characteristics (e.g., gender, race, age) through controlled, scaled comparisons.
* **Promote Transparency:** Provide clear, data-driven evidence of how different decision-making processes might treat various groups.
* **Empower Accountability:** Offer a tool for decision-makers, organizations, regulators, and civil society to evaluate and improve fairness.
* **Foster Open Collaboration:** Build a community around ethical auditing methodologies and best practices for decision-making.

This approach draws directly from a rich history of successful **paired-testing methodologies** used in civil rights and anti-discrimination efforts for decades, such as those that exposed systemic biases in housing, lending, and employment. By adapting and automating these proven techniques, `watching_u_watching` brings a scientifically rigorous and legally defensible method to modern challenges.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Our Scalable Methodology: How `watching_u_watching` Works

At the heart of `watching_u_watching` is a **rigorous, automated, paired-testing methodology** designed for high-stakes decision-making environments. We systematically uncover bias by generating pairs of nearly identical inquiries, where the only manipulated variable is the perceived demographic characteristic of the inquirer (e.g., ethnic/national origin).

This approach ensures **scalability, reproducibility, and robust findings** through:

* **Automated Probe Generation:** Fictitious identities are created and paired by script, ensuring consistent matching while varying only the independent variable. This allows for large-scale inquiry generation without human bias.
* **Meticulously Controlled Variables:** All other aspects of the inquiries‚Äîfrom content and format to timing and sender email accounts‚Äîare standardized. This isolates the causal effect of the tested characteristic.
* **Automated Data Collection & Analysis:** Emails are sent with rate-limiting, and responses are automatically monitored and processed. Data is then subjected to rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis using predefined frameworks and statistical methods to identify statistically significant patterns of discrimination, not just isolated incidents.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** Our methodology aligns with established best practices for field experiments and email audit studies, ensuring scientific rigor.
* **Strong Ethical Safeguards:** The entire process is built on a "no harm" principle, utilizing fictitious data, avoiding real Personal Identifiable Information (PII), and maintaining full transparency (e.g., notifying audited entities and open-sourcing all methodology, code, and anonymized data).

By combining these elements, `watching_u_watching` provides a systematic, verifiable, and ethically sound way to audit decision-making processes for bias, making it a powerful tool for accountability at scale.

## ‚ú® Impact & Importance

The insidious nature of systemic discrimination, especially in automated or high-volume human processes, often remains hidden. `watching_u_watching` provides a vital tool to uncover these patterns, enabling **true accountability** and driving **equitable outcomes** in critical decisions that shape lives. Our work aims to empower regulators, organizations, and civil society to build a more just and transparent future, ensuring that fairness is not just a claim, but a verifiable reality.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Strategic Directions

`watching_u_watching` is committed to fostering a more transparent and equitable ecosystem for decision-making. As we grow, our strategic focus is on maximizing impact and relevance within the evolving landscape of ethics and regulation.

Our immediate prioritization for new development and community engagement is as follows, with the goal of demonstrating a successful case and expanding our methodology's application:

### Core Regulatory & Compliance Focus (Top Priority Cases)

These represent our most immediate and impactful areas for applying `watching_u_watching` due to existing or emerging legal frameworks:

1.  **Brazil's AI Act Alignment (for AEDTs)** üáßüá∑‚öñÔ∏è
    * **Focus:** We are prioritizing development to align `watching_u_watching` with **Brazil's AI Act (Bill No. 2338/2023)**. This legislation specifically classifies AI systems in employment (AEDTs) as "high-risk" and mandates stringent requirements for bias mitigation, transparency, and Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIAs).
    * **Goal:** To establish `watching_u_watching` as a crucial tool for organizations to demonstrate compliance in this well-defined regulatory context, serving as our primary, impactful initial case study for the broader methodology.

2.  **US Regulatory Landscape & Bias Auditing** üá∫üá∏üìä
    * **Focus:** Prioritizing the application of `watching_u_watching` to address the diverse and evolving regulatory landscape for AI bias in the United States, including local ordinances (e.g., NYC Local Law 144), state-level guidelines, and federal guidance.
    * **Goal:** To develop capabilities that allow organizations to proactively audit and demonstrate compliance with US anti-discrimination laws and emerging AI regulations.
