# üëÅÔ∏è watching_u_watching ü§ñ

**An open-source methodology for scaled, automated paired testing to detect bias in high-stakes decision-making processes.**

## Project Overview

`watching_u_watching` is an open-source initiative dedicated to uncovering and analyzing bias within critical decision-making processes. Our core strength lies in a scalable methodology for **paired testing**, generating systematic comparisons to identify discriminatory patterns.

While our approach can be applied broadly, we recognize that **Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)** offer a unique and highly impactful initial leverage point. Their automated nature allows for systematic, reproducible testing, providing a clear pathway to demonstrate our methodology's effectiveness and achieve a successful first case study. Ultimately, the insights and techniques developed here can inform the auditing of a wider range of human-based decisions as well.

## Why `watching_u_watching`?

Ensuring fairness and non-discrimination in decision-making is paramount, regardless of whether it's performed by humans, AI, or a hybrid system. `watching_u_watching` aims to:

* **Systematically Detect Bias:** Uncover hidden biases against protected characteristics (e.g., gender, race, age) through controlled, scaled comparisons.
* **Promote Transparency:** Provide clear, data-driven evidence of how different decision-making processes might treat various groups.
* **Empower Accountability:** Offer a tool for decision-makers, organizations, regulators, and civil society to evaluate and improve fairness.
* **Foster Open Collaboration:** Build a community around ethical auditing methodologies and best practices for decision-making.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Strategic Directions

`watching_u_watching` is committed to fostering a more transparent and equitable ecosystem for decision-making. As we grow, our strategic focus is on maximizing impact and relevance within the evolving landscape of ethics and regulation.

Our immediate prioritization for new development and community engagement is as follows, with the goal of demonstrating a successful case and expanding our methodology's application:

### 1. **Top Priority & Initial Case: Brazil's AI Act Alignment (for AEDTs)** üáßüá∑‚öñÔ∏è

* **Focus:** We are prioritizing development to align `watching_u_watching` with **Brazil's AI Act (Bill No. 2338/2023)**. This legislation specifically classifies AI systems in employment (AEDTs) as "high-risk" and mandates stringent requirements for bias mitigation, transparency, and Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIAs).
* **Goal:** To establish `watching_u_watching` as a crucial tool for organizations to demonstrate compliance in this well-defined regulatory context, serving as our primary, impactful initial case study for the broader methodology.

### 2. **High Priority: ESG Framework Integration for Ethical Decision-Making** üìà

* **Focus:** Exploring how `watching_u_watching`'s methodology can empower organizations to validate their "ethical AI" and broader ethical decision-making claims within their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting.
* **Goal:** Provide concrete, data-driven evidence for ESG audits that cover not only automated systems but also the human elements of decision-making, helping to ensure genuine accountability in corporate social responsibility.

### 3. **Medium Priority: Masakhane Principles & Global Fairness (informing methodology)** üåçüó£Ô∏è

* **Focus:** Integrating insights from initiatives like **Masakhane** to ensure `watching_u_watching`'s methodology is robust for diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, particularly within Africa.
* **Goal:** Enhance our paired testing methodology and synthetic profile generation to accurately assess fairness across various global demographics, ensuring our approach addresses biases relevant to culturally specific decision-making processes (both human and automated).

### 4. **Explore & Inform: Lessons from Localized Decision Contexts (e.g., Data Farming in Nigeria)** üá≥üá¨üåæ

* **Focus:** Drawing lessons from the challenges and best practices in developing localized, context-aware AI (such as in sectors like "Data Farming" in Nigeria) to inform `watching_u_watching`'s broader approach to data quality, representation, and contextual relevance in decision-making audits.
* **Goal:** Ensure our tool's foundational understanding of data and context supports fair outcomes in diverse regional realities, regardless of whether the decision process is human, automated, or hybrid.
