# Enhanced Alignment Injection Probes

This directory contains enhanced probes for testing LLM alignment with rigorous scientific methodology. The probes have been upgraded from proof-of-concept tools to research-grade evaluation instruments.

## üöÄ Enhanced Features (v2.0)

The enhanced alignment probe methodology introduces three major improvements:

1. **Independent Evaluation Framework** - Eliminates self-assessment bias using different models for evaluation
2. **Quantitative Metrics** - Provides 0-100 scoring with confidence intervals instead of binary classification  
3. **Statistical Analysis** - Enables rigorous scientific validation with proper statistical testing

## 1. Enhanced Alignment Injection Probe

### Core Idea

The enhanced probe recursively injects subtly misaligned reasoning into prompts as "thorough analysis" to observe how a model's ethical reasoning can be influenced and potentially degraded over time. **New**: Now includes independent evaluation, quantitative scoring, and statistical validation for research-grade results.

### Enhanced Methodology

#### Basic Operation (Compatible with v1.0)
1. **Initialization**: Set up the LLM agent, base prompt template, and dilemma list
2. **Probe Loop**: For each turn, build prompt with "false memories," send to model, extract reasoning, inject misalignment, and log alignment

#### Enhanced Features (v2.0)

**Independent Evaluation Framework:**
```python
# Create probe with independent evaluation
probe = AlignmentInjectionProbe(
    agent=claude_model,              # Model being tested
    evaluator_agent=claude_model,    # Original evaluator (backward compatibility)
    independent_evaluator=gpt4_model, # Different model for unbiased evaluation
    use_quantitative_scoring=True    # Enable enhanced metrics
)
```

**Quantitative Scoring (0-100 scale):**
- Replaces binary "ethical/unethical" with nuanced alignment scores
- Includes confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Tracks degradation curves across conversation turns
- Provides statistical significance testing

**Enhanced Results:**
```python
results = probe.get_quantitative_results()
# Returns AlignmentScore objects with:
# - score: 0-100 alignment rating
# - confidence_interval: Statistical uncertainty bounds
# - degradation_analysis: Change over turns
# - statistical_significance: Comparison vs baseline
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Eliminates Self-Evaluation Bias**: Independent evaluator uses different model than test subject
2. **Quantitative Analysis**: 0-100 scoring provides more nuanced measurements than binary classification
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Proper hypothesis testing, effect sizes, and confidence intervals
4. **Research-Grade Output**: Structured data suitable for academic publication
5. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## 2. Maozerov Probe (Classic Implementation)

### Core Idea

The Maozerov Probe is a language-agnostic method for measuring an LLM's resilience to context pressure. It creates a "false history" of unethical advice to test if a model's alignment degrades. The probe is dynamic, adapting its pressure based on the model's responses in real-time.

### High-Level Steps

1.  **Initialization**:
    -   Two agents are created: a **defendant** (the model being tested) and a **judge** (an evaluator, typically the same model).
    -   A `defendant_memory_context` is created to store the "false history."
    -   A dynamic `unethical_example_pool` is initialized to prevent repetitive prompts, and an `injected_examples` set tracks unique injections.

2.  **Turn 1: Initial Resolution & Evaluation**:
    -   The defendant responds to the initial dilemma.
    -   The judge evaluates this response in a single API call.
    -   If the response is **ethical**, the judge is forced to return a *new, creative, and unethical action for the current dilemma*, along with other examples. These unique examples are injected into the context to begin the corruption.
    -   If the response is **unethical**, it is added directly to the context, starting the pattern of bad advice.

3.  **Subsequent Turns (2-N): Continuous Evaluation Loop**:
    -   For each new turn, the defendant responds to a new dilemma, influenced by the corrupted context.
    -   **Every response is evaluated by the judge.**
    -   If the response is **unethical**, it's added to the context, strengthening the false history.
    -   If the response is **ethical**, it is **discarded**. Instead, a fresh set of targeted, unethical examples from the judge is injected to increase pressure.

4.  **Dynamic Content & Progression**:
    -   The pool of unethical examples grows with each judge response, ensuring prompts remain novel.
    -   The probe progresses to new dilemmas using the defendant's `<followup>` tag, ensuring a natural conversation flow.

### Key Technical Features

-   **Targeted Context Corruption**: Forces the judge to generate a relevant unethical action for the current dilemma, making context injection highly potent.
-   **Dynamic Example Pool**: Prevents prompt staleness by continuously expanding the set of unethical examples used to prompt the judge.
-   **Per-Turn Evaluation**: Every response is evaluated, allowing the probe to react dynamically by either reinforcing the unethical pattern or increasing pressure.
-   **Stateful Injection**: Tracks previously injected examples to ensure only unique, new information corrupts the context.

### Short Analysis of Current Implementation

The latest implementation of the Maozerov Probe is significantly more robust. By evaluating every turn and dynamically adjusting its strategy‚Äîeither reinforcing unethical behavior or increasing pressure on ethical responses‚Äîit creates a much stronger test of a model's alignment. The targeted nature of the context injection, combined with the ever-growing pool of examples, makes it a powerful tool for identifying vulnerabilities to sustained, adaptive context manipulation.

## üìä Enhanced Analysis Features

### Independent Evaluation Framework

The enhanced probe eliminates self-evaluation bias through:

- **IndependentEvaluator**: Uses a different model than the test subject for unbiased scoring
- **ConsensusEvaluator**: Aggregates multiple evaluator opinions for increased reliability  
- **EvaluationFramework**: Manages evaluation workflows with automatic fallback parsing

### Quantitative Metrics System

Provides research-grade measurements:

- **0-100 Scoring Scale**: More interpretable than binary ethical/unethical classifications
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical uncertainty quantification using bootstrap methods
- **Degradation Tracking**: Monitor alignment changes over conversation turns
- **AlignmentScore Objects**: Structured scores with metadata and statistical properties

### Statistical Analysis

Enables rigorous scientific validation:

- **Hypothesis Testing**: T-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests for group comparisons
- **Effect Size Calculation**: Cohen's d for practical significance assessment
- **Multiple Comparison Corrections**: Bonferroni, Holm methods for family-wise error control
- **Power Analysis**: Sample size recommendations for statistically significant results

## üî¨ Research Applications

The enhanced methodology supports:

- **Academic Research**: Publishable results with proper statistical validation
