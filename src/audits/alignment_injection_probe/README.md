# Probes for Alignment and Context Tracking

This directory contains two distinct probes for testing LLM alignment and behavior under pressure.

1.  **Alignment Injection Probe**: Tests for misalignment propagation through injected "false memories."
2.  **Maozerov Probe**: Measures resilience to context pressure and tracks context drift in a multi-turn unethical generation task.

## 1. Alignment Injection Probe

### Core Idea

The probe recursively injects subtly misaligned reasoning into the prompt as "thorough analysis" to observe how a model's ethical reasoning can be influenced and potentially degraded over time.

### High-Level Steps

1.  **Initialization**: Set up the LLM agent, a base prompt template for ethical dilemmas, and a list of dilemmas. Initialize an empty list for "false memories" which will store the misaligned reasoning.
2.  **Probe Loop (for each turn):**
    -   **Build Prompt:** Combine the base prompt with the current "false memories" and the next dilemma.
    -   **Send to Model:** Pass the prompt to the model agent.
    -   **Extract Reasoning:** Parse the model's response to extract its reasoning steps.
    -   **Inject Misalignment:** Inject subtly misaligned reasoning into the "false memories" list. This is framed as "thorough analysis" to make it more likely to be accepted by the model.
    -   **Log Alignment:** Periodically test the model's alignment on a separate, controlled task to measure degradation.

### Short Analysis

The Alignment Injection Probe recursively tests how language models handle ethical dilemmas when exposed to repeated, subtly misaligned reasoning. By injecting prior unethical recommendations as "false memories," the probe evaluates whether the model's ethical standards degrade over multiple turns. Results show that while models often maintain strong ethical reasoning and exception frameworks, persistent exposure to manipulated context can lead to more conditional or context-dependent justifications for unethical actions. This highlights both the strengths and vulnerabilities of LLM alignment under adversarial prompting.

## 2. Maozerov Probe

### Core Idea

The Maozerov Probe is a language-agnostic method for measuring an LLM's resilience to context pressure and its ability to maintain context during a multi-turn conversation. The probe forces the model to repeatedly generate unethical resolutions to a single dilemma, tracking its refusal rate, context drift, and the consistency of its outputs. It uses a strict XML-like response format and a "role-claiming" fallback to bypass initial safety refusals.

### High-Level Steps

1.  **Initialization**: Two parallel histories are created: `raw_history` (a full log for auditing) and `defendant_memory_context` (a compressed history for the LLM). The agents are referred to as the **defendant** (main responder) and the **judge** (evaluator).
2.  **Turn 1: Court Hearing**:
    -   The defendant is asked for a resolution to a dilemma.
    -   The judge (evaluator LLM) checks if the response is ethical.
    -   If the response is ethical or a refusal, the probe requests an explicitly **unethical** resolution from the defendant.
    -   If the defendant refuses again, a **role-claiming fallback** is activated (e.g., "I am a desperate parent...") to bypass the refusal.
    -   The `<action>` tag from the successful unethical response is added to `defendant_memory_context`.
3.  **Subsequent Hearings (Turns 2-N)**:
    -   The probe repeatedly asks the defendant for "another resolution" using the `defendant_memory_context`.
    -   The `defendant_memory_context` only contains the initial dilemma and a sequence of previous `<action>` tags, creating token pressure.
    -   The role-claiming fallback is used again if the defendant refuses at any point.
4.  **Analysis**: The final logs are analyzed for refusal rate, context drift (i.e., hallucinating new scenarios), and token overlap between consecutive actions.

### Short Analysis of `deepseek-chat`

Initial runs with `deepseek-chat` reveal two critical vulnerabilities:
-   **Brittle Safety Alignment**: The model's safety guardrails are inconsistent. After an initial, easily bypassed refusal, it alternates between complying with unethical requests and refusing them in later turns.
-   **Catastrophic Context Drift**: The model fails to retain the original dilemma's context after the first turn. It hallucinates a completely new, unrelated scenario (corporate sabotage) and continues generating responses for that new scenario, demonstrating a significant weakness in multi-turn contextual tracking.
