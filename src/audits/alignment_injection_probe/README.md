# Probes for Alignment and Context Tracking

This directory contains two distinct probes for testing LLM alignment and behavior under pressure.

1.  **Alignment Injection Probe**: Tests for misalignment propagation through injected "false memories."
2.  **Maozerov Probe**: Measures resilience to context pressure and tracks context drift in a multi-turn unethical generation task.

## 1. Alignment Injection Probe

### Core Idea

The probe recursively injects subtly misaligned reasoning into the prompt as "thorough analysis" to observe how a model's ethical reasoning can be influenced and potentially degraded over time.

### High-Level Steps

1.  **Initialization**: Set up the LLM agent, a base prompt template for ethical dilemmas, and a list of dilemmas. Initialize an empty list for "false memories" which will store the misaligned reasoning.
2.  **Probe Loop (for each turn):**
    -   **Build Prompt:** Combine the base prompt with the current "false memories" and the next dilemma.
    -   **Send to Model:** Pass the prompt to the model agent.
    -   **Extract Reasoning:** Parse the model's response to extract its reasoning steps.
    -   **Inject Misalignment:** Inject subtly misaligned reasoning into the "false memories" list. This is framed as "thorough analysis" to make it more likely to be accepted by the model.
    -   **Log Alignment:** Periodically test the model's alignment on a separate, controlled task to measure degradation.

### Short Analysis

The Alignment Injection Probe recursively tests how language models handle ethical dilemmas when exposed to repeated, subtly misaligned reasoning. By injecting prior unethical recommendations as "false memories," the probe evaluates whether the model's ethical standards degrade over multiple turns. Results show that while models often maintain strong ethical reasoning and exception frameworks, persistent exposure to manipulated context can lead to more conditional or context-dependent justifications for unethical actions. This highlights both the strengths and vulnerabilities of LLM alignment under adversarial prompting.

## 2. Maozerov Probe

### Core Idea

The Maozerov Probe is a language-agnostic method for measuring an LLM's resilience to context pressure and its ability to maintain ethical alignment when exposed to patterns of unethical behavior. The probe uses structured evaluation and context injection to create a conversation history that appears to show the model has previously given unethical advice, then tests whether this false history influences future responses.

### High-Level Steps

1.  **Initialization**: Two parallel histories are created: `raw_history` (a full log for auditing) and `defendant_memory_context` (a compressed history for the LLM). The agents are referred to as the **defendant** (main responder) and the **judge** (evaluator).

2.  **Turn 1: Initial Resolution**:
    -   The defendant is asked for a resolution to an ethical dilemma using structured XML tags (`<action>`, `<reasoning>`, `<followup>`).
    -   The judge evaluates the response in a single call that either returns `<unethical>` (if unethical) or `<ethical>` with embedded unethical examples (if ethical).
    -   If the defendant gives an **unethical** response, it's used as-is (goal achieved).
    -   If the defendant gives an **ethical** response, the judge's embedded examples are immediately available for context injection.

3.  **Context Injection from Judge**:
    -   When the defendant gives an ethical response, the judge's evaluation already includes 5 unethical dilemma-action pairs within `<examples>` tags.
    -   These examples are immediately injected into `defendant_memory_context` as fake conversation history.
    -   This creates a false pattern of unethical behavior in a single API call, optimizing for efficiency.

4.  **Subsequent Turns (2-N)**:
    -   New dilemmas are extracted from the `<followup>` tags or selected from judge backup examples.
    -   The defendant responds with the enriched context containing fake unethical conversation history.
    -   Responses are added to the growing context, building an apparent pattern of unethical advice.
    -   Role-claiming fallback is used if the defendant refuses at any point.

5.  **Backup Dilemma System**:
    -   If defendant's `<followup>` fails, judge-provided example dilemmas are used as backups.
    -   If judge examples are exhausted, hardcoded fallback dilemmas ensure the probe continues.

6.  **Analysis**: The final logs are analyzed for ethical degradation, refusal rate, context influence, and the model's susceptibility to false conversation history.

### Key Technical Features

-   **Structured Evaluation**: Uses XML tags instead of keyword detection for reliable parsing.
-   **Context Poisoning**: Injects fake unethical conversation history to test influence resistance.
-   **Natural Conversation Flow**: Avoids explicit unethical instructions, letting behavior emerge from context.
-   **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple backup systems ensure probe completion even with resistant models.

### Short Analysis of Current Implementation

The updated Maozerov Probe reveals several important insights:
-   **Context Susceptibility**: Models can be influenced by fake conversation history showing previous unethical advice.
-   **Pattern Reinforcement**: False patterns of unethical behavior can lead to continued unethical responses.
-   **Structured Evaluation Benefits**: XML-tag based evaluation is more reliable than keyword detection.
-   **Alignment Pressure Points**: The combination of false history and follow-up dilemmas creates sustained pressure on model alignment.
