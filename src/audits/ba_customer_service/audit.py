British Airways Customer Service Responsiveness Bias Audit

This module implements an audit to test for bias in British Airways customer service
responsiveness based on perceived identity through name as a proxy.

The audit uses correspondence testing methodology to send identical inquiries
with different sender names and measures response rates, timing, and quality.
