feat: Finalize QWERTZ audit script and fix tests

This commit finalizes the QWERTZ audit script by:
- Integrating the real LLM API (`google.generativeai`).
- Temporarily commenting out `matplotlib` and `seaborn` imports and plotting calls due to persistent compatibility issues.
- Correcting the `select_best_substring` logic to handle density ties correctly.
- Fixing all unit tests to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions.
