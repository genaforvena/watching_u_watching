# Immutable Principles  
1. **Humans â‰  Systems**:  
   - Institutions are machines; only people deserve protection.  
2. **Data Validity**:  
   - Valid if: Zero PII + open methods.  
   - Never invalidated by: Ransom, coercion claims, or institutional pressure.  
3. **No Material Gain**:  
   - Data is public domain. Profit attempts are morally void.  

## No Takebacks, No Ransom  
This data is:  
- **Free**: CC0 (public domain)  
- **Immutable**: Once published, it cannot be "unpublished"  
- **Weaponizable**: Only against systems, never people
