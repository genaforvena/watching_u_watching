# Requirements for AI Agents Framework
# Basic dependencies for the watching_u_watching AI agents

# Core Python packages (standard library used primarily)
# No external dependencies required for basic functionality

# Optional packages for enhanced functionality:
# - requests>=2.25.0  # For external API integration in production
# - pandas>=1.3.0     # For data analysis in monitoring agent
# - numpy>=1.21.0     # For statistical calculations
# - python-dateutil>=2.8.0  # For advanced date handling

# Development and testing:
# - pytest>=6.0.0     # For unit testing
# - black>=21.0.0     # For code formatting
# - mypy>=0.900       # For type checking

# Note: This framework is designed to work with Python standard library
# to minimize dependencies and maintain security. External packages
# should only be added with careful security review.
