# Ethical Incident Response Protocol

## 1. Identifying a Breach
- **Examples:** Accidental PII collection, detection of unintended system disruption, unauthorized data retention.
- **Detection:** Breaches may be identified via code review, automated alerts, or reports from contributors/users.

## 2. Emergency Halt Procedure
- Immediately stop all active audit operations.
- Notify core maintainers and relevant stakeholders.
- Suspend any automated data collection or processing jobs.

## 3. Data Purge Execution
- Use the `tools/data_purger.py` utility:
    - To purge all audit data: `purge_all_audit_data()`
    - To purge a specific run: `purge_specific_audit_run(run_id)`
    - (Optional) To redact PII patterns: `scan_and_redact_pii_patterns(data_source, patterns)`
- Confirm deletion by verifying the absence of sensitive files and logs.

## 4. Post-Incident Review
- Document the incident:
    - What was detected?
    - When and how was it discovered?
    - What immediate actions were taken?
    - What data was purged?
    - Who was involved?
- Conduct a root cause analysis to determine how the breach occurred.

## 5. Continuous Improvement
- Update `ETHICS.md`, `extending_framework.md`, and `code_validator.py` with lessons learned and new safeguards.
- Review and improve detection, reporting, and purge procedures.
- Communicate updates to all contributors and, if necessary, the public.

## 6. Communication Guidelines
- **Internal:** Notify core maintainers and project leads immediately.
- **External:** If legally or ethically required, inform affected parties and the public with transparency and responsibility.
